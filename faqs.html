                    <div class="faq-question">When can I compound or claim my daily funds?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        You have two options when your daily funds accumulate:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Compound: When your daily funds reach $20, you can compound it back into your stake - this will make a new stake</li>
                            <li>Claim: Wait until your daily funds reach $25, and you can claim them back to your wallet</li>
                        </ul>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Are the funds Locked?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h2 class="category-title">Vault Questions</h2>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How do vaults work?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Vault deposit assets are not directly used in the Concentrated Liquidity Pools that the team farms to generate external revenue. This is because there is no way to sustainably use the actual growth assets to farm and still give investors back the full value of their assets, if those assets were to increase in price ‚Äî Which, of course, is the whole point of owning them.
                        <br><br>
                        Instead, our strategy to cover the APR Boost and Bonus works as follows:
                        <ul>
                            <li>We have an official partnership with a major lending firm (to be announced soon)</li>
                            <li>A portion of our back-end treasury assets, along with a small percentage of vault deposits, is leveraged with our lending partner</li>
                            <li>The funds borrowed are then farmed to generate additional yield</li>
                            <li>This yield offsets the Boost and Bonus rewards, while ensuring the dollar value of users vault assets reflect the live market value</li>
                            <li>The borrowed funds are repaid with CLP profits, and any necessary rewards are distributed to the vaults as needed</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        This approach is simple, low-risk, and ensures sustainability. While it doesn't generate much in the way of direct profit for the team, it provides a reliable way for the community to earn safely while making our platform more attractive in the long run.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What are the vault tiers?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Vaults offer different tiers with varying benefits and requirements. Each tier has its own minimum deposit requirement and reward structure. Refer to the vault guide for specific details about each tier.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What is The Warchest?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        The Warchest serves as a distinct treasury for the Developers at PACA Finance. This fund is used to manage any airdrops, extra profits, or additional revenue derived from their own investments.
                        <br><br>
                        Having a treasury is crucial; any extra income generated will be directed toward ensuring you continue to earn rewards on your investment, rather than being used for promotions or giveaways.
                        <br><br>
                        Think of it as a rainy-day fund ‚Äî an essential component for sound investment strategies and long-term sustainability.
